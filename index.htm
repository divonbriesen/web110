				<li><span class="category">Personal Background:</span>
					I was born and raised in Russia, but always believed that I did not belong there. So I moved to the States 3 years ago. I have a 7-year-old daughter and a 2-year-old cat.
				</li>
				<li><span class="category">Professional/Academic Background:</span>
					I work full-time as a purchasing specialist in an Austrian company. It's my second year in CPCC, I am happy to be back after my 2-semester break.
				</li>
				<li><span class="category">Information/Technology background:</span>
					 I took programmer classes when I was 14 years old, but was not interested in being a programmer at all, so I've never used any of my knowledge. As a result I am an advanced PC user, but not more than that. When I moved to the States I started thinking about changing my career path and I ended up choosing computers!
				</li>
				<li><span class="category">Primary Computer Platform:</span> macOS Mojave at home and Windows 10 at work.
				</li>
				<li><span class="category">Courses I’m taking, & why:</span> Each of these is required for my degree.
					<ul>
						<li>WEB-250 - Required class
						</li>
						<li>WEB-215 - Required class
						</li>
						<li>DBA-120 - Required class
						</li>
						<li>CTI-289 - Required class
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="category">Something to remember me by:</span>  Not funny, but motivational :) I really believe in the Power of Thoughts and I have proof. I've been dreaming to move to the USA since I was 12, but knew it was close to impossible. So I found a picture of a green card, photoshopped it with my own photo and information, printed it out and hung on the wall. I looked at that green card every day dreaming about getting one and...I did! I won the Lottery! (it's less than 1 % chance of winning, so you know how great it is).
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="category">I would also like to share:</span> Recently decided to be more active on Instagram - but understand that being a blogger is a hard work!
